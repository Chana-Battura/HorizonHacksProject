In the midst of this pandemic, small and local businesses have taken the brunt of the economic crash. Our website aims to help these businesses by helping give internet exposure to small businesses. This website will help turn greater profits at the local scale, and help everybody get through this lockdown.

A website designed to divert internet traffic from large transnational restaurants, to local small-scale restaurants in order to keep businesses from going under and the economy to keep crashing.
